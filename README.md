# Gauge Data Generator with NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator

This project generates synthetic data using NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator to simulate a pressure gauge environment. The script renders images, semantic data, and bounding boxes while also normalizing and recording the rotation of the gauge needle for each frame.

### Prerequisites

1. IsaacSim 4.2.0+
2. Nucleus
3. A suitable analog gauge model needs to be imported to Nucleus. 

### Execution
The easiest way to execute this script is to copy it into the script editor in Isaac Sim or execution from VSCode + Isaac Sim VSCode Plugin
